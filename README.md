Tab delimited SQLite scripts

This project will be a single Python script that will manage processing one or more tab-delimited files (perhaps CSV too) with SQLite. This will import the tab-delimited files into a temporary SQLite db file, perform a query, and then destroy the file. It should be quick and easy.
